###### How long have you known Jeremy?
I've known Jeremy for, at least, four years.

###### How did you meet Jeremy?
I don’t recall with absolute certainty. If not through the Technology Commons;
it would have been through Angie or Jaynan.

###### Favorite memory with Jeremy?
There are many: Game of Axis and Allies, D&D Campaigns galore, visits to Lucky’s
for beer and pizza; however, I would have to say that it was one of the earliest
memories that I have with Jeremy that stands out.

We were attempting our first D&D session, but novice role-players at this point.
We had taken to surveying a location by separating. Alex, being our token
stealth character, attempted to infiltrate a space, which we had heard sounds
coming from. It was a brief, and we thought, innocuous warning and we proceeded
with caution thrown to the wind. Little did we know at the time that an ambush
would proceed. Wolves, and an enigmatic figure known as a ‘Bugbear’ would
decimate our entire company and in a fell swoop, completely squash our thieving
companion: ‘Joe.’ Well wishes, buddy.

That moment, if brief, was our first foray into various campaigns that we have
taken over the years and set the stage for other elaborate games that we’ve
played, including but not limited to: Betrayal of the House on the Hill, Game of
Thrones, Axis & Allies, and it’s compelled a new generation of D&D participants
to move from PC’s to DM’s in their own right. Jeremy was the pioneer, mentor,
and fellow that opened a new level of geekdom that I revel in to this day and
beyond. I look forward to making new memories for the rest of our days as
friend.
