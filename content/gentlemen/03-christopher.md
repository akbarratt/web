###### How long have you known Jeremy?
11 years

###### How did you meet Jeremy?
I met Jeremy in our freshman year of high school and I didn’t start talking to
him until around the second semester. We both had the same first period class
and I overheard him talking about a video game series that I knew about and it
sort of went from there. We had very similar hobbies that we enjoyed talking
about

###### Favorite memory with Jeremy?
My favorite memory is probably the time that Jeremy, Jayne and I went camping
at Tosohatchee. Jeremy brought his old telescope and we decided to chill and
look at the night sky. Jayne and Jeremy even claim to have seen a UFO that
night and ended up calling the National UFO Reporting Center. I didn’t believe
them.
